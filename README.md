The aim of this work is to design a system for generating valid chess positions satisfying predefined constraints. The constraints are e.g. specification of the number and types of player pieces, the level of players in whose game the chess position was created, etc.  Assume constraints applied to only one of the players. 
1. Study the available literature on the problem.
2. Design an appropriate player model (use NN and game tree search algorithms), design an evaluation function to control the game. 
3. Using a database of chess games played, perform data collection for training. 
4. Implement and train the model, design experiments and evaluate them.
